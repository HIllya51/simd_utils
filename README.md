# simd_utils
A header only library implementing common mathematical functions using SIMD intrinsics

Thanks to Julien Pommier and Giovanni Garberoglio for their work on sin,cos,log, and exp functions in SSE, AVX, and NEON intrinsics.

## What is SIMD Utils?

The purpose of this library is to give an open-source implementation of SIMD optimized commonly used algorithms. 

## Building

To build the project you will need the sse_mathfun.h, avx_mathfun.h and neon_mathun.h headers available here http://gruntthepeon.free.fr/ssemath/, and there http://software-lisc.fbk.eu/avx_mathfun/


## Licence

This library is released under BSD licence so that everyone can freely use it in their project, find bugs, propose new functions or enhance existing ones.
